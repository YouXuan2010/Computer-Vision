## Feature Detection

Feature detection and matching are crucial tasks in many computer vision applications, including structure-from-motion, image retrieval, object detection, and more. In this series, we will focus on local feature detection and matching.

### Overview

This repository will cover some of the algorithms for feature detection:

1. Harris Corner Detector
2. SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
3. SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)
4. FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test)
5. BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)
6. ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

### Applications

Feature detection and matching find applications in various domains, including:

- Automate object tracking
- Point matching for computing disparity
- Stereo calibration (Estimation of the fundamental matrix)
- Motion-based segmentation
- Recognition
- 3D object reconstruction
- Robot navigation
- Image retrieval and indexing

### Features

A feature is a piece of information relevant to solving computational tasks in a specific application. Features can be classified into two main categories:

1. **Keypoint Features**: Localized features in specific locations of images, such as corners or interesting patches. 
2. **Edges**: Features that can be matched based on their orientation and local appearance, such as edge profiles.

### Main Components of Feature Detection and Matching

The process of feature detection and matching involves three main components:

1. **Detection**: Identifying the interest points or keypoints in an image.
2. **Description**: Describing the local appearance around each feature point in a way that is invariant under various transformations.
3. **Matching**: Comparing descriptors across images to identify similar features and establish correspondences.

### Interest Point

An interest point or feature point is a point in an image that is expressive in texture and stable under local and global perturbations. Properties of interest points include:

- Well-defined position in image space
- Stability under image variations
- Efficient detection

### Feature Descriptor

A feature descriptor is an algorithm that takes an image and outputs feature descriptors or feature vectors. Descriptors encode information about the local neighborhood of a point and are used for matching features across images. Descriptors can be categorized into local and global descriptors.

### Features Matching

Features matching involves establishing correspondences between features in two or more images. The performance of matching methods depends on both the properties of the interest points and the choice of descriptors. Common algorithms for feature detection and matching include brute-force matcher and FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) matcher.

### Algorithm For Feature Detection And Matching

The general steps for feature detection and matching are as follows:

1. Find a set of distinctive keypoints.
2. Define a region around each keypoint.
3. Extract and normalize the region content.
4. Compute a local descriptor from the normalized region.
5. Match local descriptors.
