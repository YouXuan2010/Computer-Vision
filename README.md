     ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - After pushing your changes, navigate to the repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Pull Requests" tab and then click "New pull request".
   - Select the base branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and your feature branch.
   - Provide a descriptive title and description for your pull request.
   - Click "Create pull request" to submit it for review.

8. **Review and Merge**:
   - Wait for your pull request to be reviewed by a repository maintainer.
